Carpoozle | PennApps Hackathon Fall 2013

80% of highway car seats are empty. Carpoozle is a real-time carpooling app that allows a driver to share their empty seats with passengers for a price. Carpoozle focuses on trips that are currently in progress and ones that are about to start in 30 minutes or less.
